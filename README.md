# 🧠 Social Media Extremism Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the automatic detection of extremist and radicalized content on social media platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques, with a particular emphasis on Transformer-based models. The rapid growth of user-generated content online has increased the need for intelligent systems capable of identifying harmful discourse and supporting early intervention and content moderation efforts.

Developed within the framework of an academic internship in Data Science, this project combines research-oriented analysis with practical implementation to address a real-world societal challenge.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze textual data collected from social media platforms  
- Identify patterns of extremist and radicalized discourse  
- Apply and compare Machine Learning and Deep Learning models  
- Fine-tune Transformer-based architectures for text classification  
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics  
- Build a scalable and reusable NLP pipeline  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: Python  
- Environment: Anaconda  
- Libraries & Frameworks:
  - NumPy, Pandas  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch  
  - Hugging Face Transformers  
  - NLTK / SpaCy  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Development Tools: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook  

## 🧪 Methodology

The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. Data Collection & Understanding  
2. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, tokenization)  
3. Feature Representation (TF-IDF, embeddings, Transformers)  
4. Modeling (ML, Deep Learning, Transformers)  
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Deep Neural Networks (DNN)  
- Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa)  

Transformer-based models demonstrated superior performance due to their ability to capture contextual and semantic information within text data.

## 📊 Results & Findings

Experimental results indicate that Deep Learning and Transformer-based models significantly outperform traditional machine learning approaches in detecting extremist content. These models show improved accuracy and robustness, particularly in understanding complex linguistic patterns and contextual dependencies present in radicalized discourse.
